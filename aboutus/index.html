<p>Global Foundation for Ethics &amp; Spiritual Health (GFESH) was established in 2014 with the single objective to bring science &amp; spirituality together. GFESH is today playing an instrumental role in bringing medical &amp; healthcare practitioners together to evolve a new holistic healthcare system based on ethical principles.</p>

<p>The 21st Century healthcare needs a paradigm shift from focus on the treatment of disease to the promotion of wellness of communities, families and individuals that is patient-centered and community-based. Our society is today searching for holistic solutions to health which includes the mind, body and the soul. This kind of a healthcare system will always remain elusive if it is not based on the principles of medical &amp; spiritual ethics.</p>

<h2 id="1-our-objectives">1. Our Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>To bring science &amp; spirituality together with the aim to provide holistic healthcare solutions encompassing the mind, body and soul.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="2-our-activites">2. Our Activites</h2>

<p>To help establish a paradigm shift in 21st Century healthcare from a focus on the treatment of disease states to the promotion of wellness of communities, families and individuals that is patient-centered and community-based. To that end, we propose the following:</p>

<li>Reincorporation of the traditional knowledge and spiritual science of healing into the modern science of healthcare – embracing body, mind, spirit with the closer involvement of medical community.</li>
<li>Restoration of a healthy relationship with the nature , environment and natural way of living encompassing a holistic approach.</li>
<li>Management of the treatment of disease with emphasis on lifestyle changes, with focus on behaviors and self-responsibility besides recoding the facts.</li>

<li>Proposing transition from the current health care delivery model to one of collaboration, partnership and with deeper understanding of human needs.</li>
<li>Reduce the cost and improve outcomes in healthcare by bringing in mind set changes in health care delivery by incorporating the learnings in the medical and para medical education as proper structured curriculum.</li>
<li>Recognition of a fundamental belief that Unconditional Love is life’s most powerful Healer and to study the correlation and effectiveness of counseling and such healing, on the patients.</li>

<h2 id="4-our-inspiration">4. Our Inspiration</h2>

<p>His Holiness Radhanath Swami is a Vaishnava sanyasi and teacher of the devotional path of Bhakti-yoga. He is author of The Journey Home a memoir of his search for spiritual truth. His teachings draw from the sacred texts of India such as The Bhagavad-gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, and Ramayana, and aim to reveal the practical application of the sacred traditions, while focusing on the shared essence, which unites apparently disparate religious or spiritual paths.
Born Richard Slavin, on December 7, 1950, in his teens he came to confront a deep sense of alienation from suburban Chicago life and the civil injustices of mid-century America. At the age of nineteen, while on a summer trip to Europe, his internal struggles culminated in a commitment to search for God wherever it might lead him. Meditating on the Isle of Crete, he felt a supernatural calling and the next morning set off alone to find spiritual India.
His book,“The Journey Home” documents his odyssey as a penniless hitchhiker though Greece, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and finally India. There he lived as a wandering ascetic, first amongst the forest dwelling Himalayan yogis and later amongst a wide variety of gurus and spiritual practitioners throughout India and Nepal. Ultimately, he was led to the holy town of Vrindavan, where he found his path amongst the Bhakti-yogis.
In Vrindavan he found the teacher he was searching for in A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977) the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), and representative of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. In choosing Bhaktivedanta Swami, as his guru, Radhanath Swami felt compelled to shear his matted locks and reenter Western society with a mission to share the sacred wisdom he had received. This return exemplifies the form of devotional yoga which is at the heart of Radhanath Swami’s teachings, a spiritual practice expressed as tangible action meant to bring about personal fulfillment and benefit the world.
At the the age of 31 he took the monastic vows of a Vaishnava sanyasi and became known as Radhanath Swami.</p>

<p>Today Radhanath Swami travels regularly throughout India, Europe and North America, sharing the teachings of Bhakti-yoga. He resides much of the year at the Radha Gopinath Ashram in Chowpatty, Mumbai.</p>

<p>For the past twenty-five years he has guided the community’s development and has directed a number of acclaimed social action projects including Midday Meals, which daily serves more than 260,000 plates of sanctified vegetarian food to the children of the slums of Mumbai. He has also worked to establish missionary hospitals and eye camps, eco-friendly farms, schools and ashrams, an orphanage, and a number of emergency relief programs throughout India.</p>

<p>HIS BESTSELLING BOOK – THE JOURNEY HOME</p>

<p>Within this extraordinary memoir, Radhanath Swami weaves a colorful tapestry of adventure, mysticism, and love. Readers follow Richard Slavin from the suburbs of Chicago to the caves of the Himalayas as he transforms from young seeker to renowned spiritual guide.
The Journey Home is an intimate account of the steps to self awareness and a penetrating glimpse into the heart of mystic traditions and the challenges that all souls must face on the road to inner harmony and a union with the Divine. Through near-death encounters, apprenticeships with advanced yogis, and years of travel along the pilgrim’s path, Radhanath Swami eventually reaches the inner sanctum of India’s mystic culture and finds the love he has been seeking. It is a tale told with rare candor, immersing the reader in a journey that is at once engaging, humorous, and heartwarming.</p>
